This is just a quick summary of tutorials I used in order to get started with Linux kernel development. I think it is quite hard to know what resources are good to start with, since some are pure theory and others are to far away from reality. I am basing this selection on my preferences. I generally like hands on tutorial with the combination of theory.

## A collection
Here is a sorted list of tutorials in the order which I recommend diving into it.

1. How to Build A Custom Linux Kernel For QEMU (2015 Edition), by [Mitchel Humpherys](http://mgalgs.github.io/2015/05/16/how-to-build-a-custom-linux-kernel-for-qemu-2015-edition.html).

  This fine piece gives you an overview on how to build the kernel an load it into a emulator called QEMU.
2. Linux From Scratch, Version 9.0, by [Gerard Beekmans](http://www.linuxfromscratch.org/lfs/view/stable/index.html)

  This tutorial is a good hands on guide with a lot of explanation, ideal for getting the hands dirty.

3. Linux Kernel Development by [Robert Love](https://www.amazon.com/Linux-Kernel-Development-Robert-Love/dp/0672329468).

  This is more for the theory side of the kernel, the book describes concepts based on code - walkthroughs, but in my opinion is missing the hands on part. That's why I think this piece is good for filling the knowledge gaps, rather then starting.
